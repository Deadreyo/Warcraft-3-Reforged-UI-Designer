# Reforged UI Maker (RUID)

**A cross-platform desktop application made to create User Interface designs and systems for Warcraft 3 Maps without code.**

The application terminates the need for coding in favor of creating draggable graphical elements to express the design. Its easy-to-learn mechanics and concepts make it easy and usable for non-coders or GUI users to create fully-fledged UI systems, and its precision, speed and saved templates make it viable for Professionals and Veterans to make their systems in minutes, instead of typically hours or days.

It produces code in a file that can be opened by a text editor, then copied and pasted into a World Editor trigger or Custom Script. It works on Warcraft III version 1.31+

The main goal of the application is to take WC3 UI modding to the next level, by facilitating UI creation and allowing anyone to design their own unique UI, without any prerequisite coding knowledge. This application is made to be used by GUI coders, Jass coders, LUA coders and Typescript coders. For Typescript, it is specifically made to work with TriggerHappy's TSTL template.
